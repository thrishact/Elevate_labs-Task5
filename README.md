# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract insights using statistical summaries and visual exploration techniques.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- Dataset: Titanic Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- The dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
2. Explored the dataset structure using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()`.
3. Handled missing values for age and embarkation columns.
4. Performed univariate analysis using histograms and boxplots.
5. Performed bivariate analysis using count plots and scatter plots.
6. Conducted multivariate analysis using pair plots and correlation heatmaps.
7. Identified relationships, trends, and anomalies in the data.
8. Documented observations and summarized key findings.

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive than third-class passengers.
- Higher fare-paying passengers showed better survival chances.
- Age alone was not a strong factor influencing survival.
- Fare distribution contained significant outliers.

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) containing EDA code and visualizations
- PDF report summarizing findings and observations

## Outcome
This project improved understanding of data exploration techniques and helped develop skills in identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies using real-world data.
